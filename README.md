# Hack-A-Thing-1

I didn't take CS52 at Dartmouth, and I believe WebDev is an important tool to have.
Since most of the projects will have some sort of WebDev, I thought it would be useful to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I built a very simple website using HTML and CSS. The website has a text input, returning some insight concerning the input product.
The idea of this website also relates to a possible project idea that I will talk more about on Thursday.


I took https://www.codecademy.com/learn's 'Web Development' course. It's quite long and I believe that it will take me 2 more weeks to
finish the entire course. Right now, I'm about 25% done.

I worked alone.

Thank you,
Sedat
